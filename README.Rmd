The gist package provides a set of functions to work with [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). It allows you to copy, create, and delete gists via the GitHub API. Moreover, it provides an RStudio addin - a shiny app - to interact with your gists.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gist like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/gist")
```

In order to retrieve data, you need to provide a GitHub API token (`github_api`) with the `keyring` package. Use the `key_set()` function to store the token:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Save GitHub API token as github_api
keyring::key_set(service = "github_api")
```

## Example

Go to the addin menu or use the following code to open the gist app. The app shows a list with your gist files and a preview of the code. Pick your gist and copy or insert the code. Furthermore, the app has tabs to create and delete gists as well.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Run gist_addin()
gist::gist_addin()
```

If you want to interact via R, you can use the following functions:

```{r}
#gistfiles lists all files and returns names and ids
gist::gistfiles() |> 
  head()
```

The package includes a get, create, and delete function. The following code shows how to get a gist:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#gistfiles lists all files and returns names and ids
gist::get_gist(filename = "DBI_connect.R")

#> âœ” Copied DBI_connect.R from your GitHub account.
```
