The gist package provides a set of functions to work with [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). It allows you to copy, create, and delete gists via the GitHub API. Moreover, it comes with an R Studio addin - a shiny app - to manage your Gists.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gist like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/gist")
```

In order to connect with the Git Hub API, you need to provide a GitHub API token (names as: `github_api`) with the `keyring` package. Use the `key_set()` function to store your token safely:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Save GitHub API token as github_api
keyring::key_set(service = "github_api")
```

## Workflow

There is no need to learn how the package works, because it comes with an R Studio addin that let you manage Gists. Go to the addin menu or use the following code to open the gist app. The app shows a list with your gist files and a preview of the code. Pick a gist and copy or insert the code. Furthermore, the app has tabs to create and delete gists as well.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#The gistAddin()
library(gist)
gist::gistAddin()
```

If you want to interact via R, you can use the following functions. Create a new Gist via:


```{r}
#Create a gist
gist_create(name = "A_Test.R", 
            code = '#Test
            print("Hello world")', 
            description = "Test Gist")
```

Get a gist via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#gistfiles lists all files and returns names and ids
gist_get(filename = "A_Test.R")

#> âœ” Copied A_Test.R from your GitHub account.
```

Set the `raw` parameter to `TRUE` in case you need the raw character vector. Finally, let us delete a gist. Therefore, you need to inspect your gists to get to know the id of a gist.

```{r}
#gistFiles lists all files and returns names and ids
mygists <- gist::gistFiles()
mygists |> head()
```


To delete a gist, give the id the `gist_delete()` function.

```{r}
#Delete a gist
gist::gist_delete(id = mygists$id[1])
```
