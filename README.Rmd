The gist package provides a set of functions to work with the GitHub Gist. It allows you to create, read, update and delete gists via the GitHub API. Moreover, it provides R Studio adding - a shiny app - to interact with gists.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gist like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/gist")
```

In order to retrieve data, you need to provide a GitHub API token (`github_api`) with the `keyring` package. Use the `key_set()` function code to save the token:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Save GitHub API token as github_api
keyring::key_set(service = "github_api")
```

## Example

Go to the addin menu or use the following code to open the gist app:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Run gist_addin()
gist::gist_addin()
```

![](man/figures/gistapp.png){width="70%"}

If you want to interact via CLI, you can use the following functions:


```{r}
#gistfiles lists all files and returns names and ids
gist::gistfiles()
```

To work with your files, the package includes get, create, and delete functions. The following code shows how to get a gist:

```{r}
#gistfiles lists all files and returns names and ids
gist::get_gist("DBI_connect.R")
```
